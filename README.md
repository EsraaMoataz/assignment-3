Problem :

Draw triangle with GLFW

-By using GLFW that enabled me to draw a multi color triangle with multi shader that :

first:

-creating a window by using function
  {glfwCreateWindow}
  
- Check if the window is created or not ,if doesn't created output "Failed to create GLFW window" and terminate.

- load all OpenGL function pointers using function {gladLoadGLLoader}.

-Build and compile my shader program .

-Using function {glCreateShader} to create shader.

- create vertex shader "glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER);".
